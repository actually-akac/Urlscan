  ðŸ”Ž An async and lightweight C# library for interacting with the Urlscan API.
</div>

## Usage
This library provides an easy interface for interacting with the Urlscan API.
You can use this library to automate your Urlscan submissions, search for existing scans, track newly submitted scans and analyse network activity of malicious websites.

To get started, import the library into your solution with either the `NuGet Package Manager` or the `dotnet` CLI.
```rust
dotnet add package Urlscan
```

For the primary classes to become available, import the used namespace.
```csharp
using Urlscan;
```

Need more examples? Under the `Example` directory you can find a working demo project that implements this library.

### Obtaining API keys
API keys can be created under the user section `Settings & API`.

Secure identifier SID cookies can be obtained from your browser's cookie storage. Make sure to only copy the value, without the name! 

## Properties
- Built for **.NET 8**, **.NET 7** and **.NET 6**
- Fully **async**
- Extensive **XML documentation**
- Coverage of the free API endpoints, including some user-only and beta routes
- **No external dependencies** (makes use of built-in `HttpClient` and `JsonSerializer`)
- **Custom exceptions** (`UrlscanException`) for easy debugging
- Parsing of custom Urlscan errors
- Example project to demonstrate all capabilities of the library

## Features
- Scan suspicious URLs and submit verdicts on them
- Search for public scans using ElasticSearch queries
- Download screenshots and page DOMs
- Empower your threat intelligence with live scans through `LiveClient`

## Code Samples

### Initializing a new API client
```csharp
UrlscanClient client = new("d339bf51-9bc7-4d6a-a960-a264896b1891");
```

### Getting the current user
```csharp
User user = await client.GetCurrentUser();
```

### Submitting a new scan
```csharp
Submission subm = await client.Scan(new ScanParameters()
{
    Url = "https://example.com",
    Tags = new string[] { "test" },
    Country = ScanCountry.FI,
    UserAgent = "My-Custom-Scanner/1.0.0",
    OverrideSafety = false,
    Referer = "https://google.com",
    Visibility = Visibility.Public
});
```

### Polling a submission for the result
```csharp
Result res = await client.Poll(subm);
```

### Getting similar scans
```csharp
SimilarScan[] similar = await client.GetSimilarScans("bc1ef5f2-eddc-40ae-86c9-fb5894b5d1f2");
```

### Processing newly created scans in real time
```csharp
LiveClient live = new();
live.UrlScanned += (sender, scan) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine(scan.Task.URL[..Math.Min(scan.Task.URL.Length, 50)]);
};
```

### Adding a verdict to a scan
```csharp
await client.AddVerdict(new VerdictParameters()
{
    UUID = "8964cc71-ea31-476c-ba8f-863bf4bf6b2f",
    Comment = "Running a Discord phishing scam with Discord HypeSquad as their target.",
    Scope = VerdictScope.PageDomain,
    ScopeValue = "contact-hype-testers.com",
    ThreatTypes = new ThreatType[]
    {
        ThreatType.Phishing,
        ThreatType.BrandImpersonation
    },
    Brands = new string[]
    {
        "Discord"
    },
    Verdict = VerdictType.Malicious
});
```
